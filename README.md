# Housing_Price_Predictions

## Project Overview:
### The goal of this project is to build a machine-learning model that predicts housing prices based on various features such as square footage, number of bedrooms, location, and other relevant factors. The project will involve data collection, preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and deployment. We will use Scikit-learn for machine learning, Python Pandas for data manipulation, and Matplotlib for data visualization.

### Data Collection and Exploration
#### Identify and acquire a dataset containing housing-related features and prices.
#### Load the dataset into a Jupyter Notebook.
#### Explore the dataset to understand its structure and characteristics.
#### Handle missing data, duplicates, and outliers.

### Data Preprocessing
#### Preprocess categorical features
#### Scale or normalize numerical features.
#### Split the dataset into training and testing

### Model Selection and Training 
#### Choose appropriate regression algorithms for the task (e.g., Linear Regression).
#### Split the training data into cross-validation folds for model selection.
#### Train and evaluate multiple models using cross-validation.
#### Select the best-performing model based on evaluation metrics 

### Model Evaluation
#### Evaluate the selected model on the test dataset.
#### Calculate evaluation metrics (e.g., Mean Absolute Error, R-squared).
#### Visualize the model's performance using Matplotlib.

### Project Presentation
#### Prepare a presentation summarizing the project's objectives, methodology, and results.
#### Present the project to stakeholders or peers.

### Resources:
#### Python programming skills
#### Jupyter Notebook for code development
#### Scikit-learn for machine learning
#### Python Pandas for data manipulation
#### Matplotlib for data visualization
#### GitHub or another version control platform for project management

### Deliverables:
#### Jupyter Notebook containing code and documentation
#### Project report
#### Project presentation
#### Deployed model (if applicable)
#### Risks and Challenges:
#### Availability and quality of the dataset
#### Model performance may not meet expectations
#### Time constraints for fine-tuning and deployment

### Conclusion:
#### This project plan outlines the steps and timeline for a Housing Price Prediction project using machine learning. It's essential to follow the plan rigorously, document each step thoroughly, and adapt as needed based on the project's progress and challenges encountered along the way.
